# Elixir Jobs - A Tutorial

## This code is based off of this tutorial:
"Let's Build Web App With Phoenix and Ecto"
* http://www.elixirdose.com/post/lets-build-web-app-with-phoenix-and-ecto

To start your new Phoenix application you have to:

1. Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
2. Start Phoenix router with `mix phoenix.start`

Now you can visit `localhost:4000` from your browser.


## Notes

* If you choose to change the application's structure, you could manually start the router from your code like this `ElixirJobs.Router.start`
